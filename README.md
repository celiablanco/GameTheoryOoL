# From Rule-Taking to Rule-Making Chemistry

This repository contains the code and figure-generation scripts accompanying the manuscript:

**“From Rule-Taking to Rule-Making Chemistry: A Minimal Population–Environment Feedback Model”**

The project develops minimal dynamical models to study how chemical populations transition from passively adapting to their environment (rule-taking) to actively modifying and sustaining favorable conditions (rule-making). The focus is on feedback, bistability, and environmental persistence in origins-of-life contexts.

## Scope and limitations

This repository is intended as a **conceptual and theoretical companion** to the manuscript. The models are deliberately minimal and do not aim to reproduce specific chemical reaction networks or experimental systems. Instead, they are designed to clarify general dynamical principles relevant to the emergence of self-sustaining, environment-modifying chemical behavior.
