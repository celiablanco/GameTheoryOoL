\section{Conclusion}
We presented a compact game-theoretic model capturing a phase transition from rule-taking to rule-making chemistry. The threshold $p_c$ delineates when environmental feedback enables rule-modifying molecules to sustain themselves, transforming fixed-rule dynamics into self-determined constraints. This framing clarifies agency as endogenous rule formation and highlights a potential origin-of-life pathway: once molecules can reshape their selective landscape, they acquire the leverage needed for open-ended evolution. The simplicity of the model invites extensions to richer chemistries, spatial organization, and information processing, offering a bridge between complexity science, artificial life, and prebiotic evolution.
